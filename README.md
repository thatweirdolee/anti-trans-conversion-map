# Anti-Trans Conversion Therapy Map of Influence

## Summary
A network map of 15 major groups or projects and their known clinical affiliates that have connections to "gender exploratory" therapy theorycrafting, leadership engagement, or promotion.  
  
## Purpose
This tool is designed to support journalists, researchers, and trans or gender diverse community organizers in understanding the international spread of "gender exploratory" therapy as a form of conversion practice targeting transgender, detransitioned, and gender diverse individuals. The aim is to identify relationships between emerging leaders in the development of clinical anti-trans conversion therapy, as well as their scope of influence expanding into different regions of the world.

Presently this map does not cover religious-based anti-trans conversion practices, though overlap is emerging and expected to grow (see: IFTCC, ACPeds). *It is not designed to identify or be used as a directory of individual practicing clinicians.* It is merely meant to highlight the astroturfed and/or highly connected nature of these groups and their growing reach.

As the concept of "gender exploratory" therapy is a rapidly emerging trend, these networks are subject to change over time.
  
## Methodology
Network map developed using Gephi and Sigma.js. Data was gathered from public organization records. Groups or projects were chosen based on their historic and current interest in the clinical adaptation of anti-trans conversion practices, using disinformation surrounding detransition, desistence, and "rapid onset gender dysphoria", combined with their overlapping founders or affiliates of major influence.
